# React-Portfolio

## Description

This is a profile to display my work and details, using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which draws together elements of JavaScript, HTML and CSS!

Each page is broken down to it's own file, which are then brought in via the *Nav.jsx* ad *main.jsx* files which load the corresponding content for the page ending the route. Files within the *components* folder handle page functionality and elements of the page that are consistent across the site.
